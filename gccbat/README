First, rewrite the configure file to set up the directories, options (and actions).

Then, run the command:
  gccbat -f config.sh -d
to print the running commands.

If the running commands are correct, then run it actually:
  gccbat -f config.sh

Also, actions can be specified through command line:
  gccbat -f config.sh -a "..."

Files under "contrib" are copied from gcc/contrib.  File gccbat is implemented
based on them.
